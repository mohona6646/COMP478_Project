# COMP478 Project: Face Mask Detection

This is a project that utilizes image processing and deep learning techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The project involves preprocessing images of faces to extract relevant features, and using a convolutional neural network, Inception V3 to classify the images.  The model is trained on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces to learn how to distinguish between them. This project allows to enforce mask-wearing policies in public places promoting health, and reducing the burden on the healthcare system.
